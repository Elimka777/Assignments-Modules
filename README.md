Assignments:
1. Python Modules and Data Handling Assignment- I created a Python program using a custom module that asks the user how they are feeling today and responds with a custom message based on the mood entered.
2. Exploring Python Modules and Data Structures Assignment- I created a Python script using a custom module to manage a contact list. The script allows adding, removing, and displaying contacts stored in a list.
3. Mastering Python Modules and Aliases- I created a custom module named text_utils.py with functions for string manipulation. I imported this module using an alias and utilize its functions in my main script.
